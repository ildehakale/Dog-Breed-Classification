# Dog Breed Classification (0.84 Accuracy)
 
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based dog breed classification system. The main goal is to accurately classify dog breeds using image data. It utilizes several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including ResNet50, VGG19, MobileNetV2, and Xception, along with a custom CNN to compare performance.

Key elements of the project include:

Data Preparation: Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation) and handling class imbalances ensure robust model performance.
Models Used: Pre-trained models were fine-tuned on a dataset of dog images. Xception performed the best with a test accuracy of 84.69%.
Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to compare model effectiveness.
Results: Xception excelled, showcasing its ability to capture intricate breed-specific details, while VGG19 struggled due to overfitting and computational complexity.
The study highlights the transformative potential of deep learning for animal identification and proposes future improvements, such as adding mixed breeds, ensemble learning, and advanced data augmentation.
